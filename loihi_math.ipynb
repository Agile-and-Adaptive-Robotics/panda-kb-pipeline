    "Loihi uses the leaky-integrate-and-fire model which has two internal state variables: \n",
    "1) **$u_i(t)$: the synaptic response current**  \n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "- $i$ indicates the index of the post-syntapic neuron (in Loihi neuron are represented as compartments)\n",
    "- $j$ indicates the index of the pre-syntapic neuron\n",
    "- $\\delta_i^(u)$ represents the current decay (Default = 4096)\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\tau = e^{(-t/\\tau)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "- $u_i(t)$ is the compartment's state current at timestep $t$. The compartment current integrates incoming weighted spikes from the dendritic accumulators and possibly inputs from other compartments but decays exponentially otherwise\n",
    "2) **$v_t(t)$: the membrane voltage potential**\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v_i(t) = v_i(t-1) \\cdot (2^{12} - VoltageDecay) * 2^{-12} + u_i(t) + (biasMant*2^{biasExp})\n",
